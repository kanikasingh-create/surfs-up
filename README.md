# Surf's Up!

This analysis shows that there are enough customers between seasons to sustain the business throughout the year. The analysis will:
* Determine key statistical data about the month of June.
* Determine key statistical data about the month of December.
* Compare findings between the month of June and December.
* Make recommendations for further analysis.

The findings of this analysis are shared below, as well as in the above Jupyter notebook.

## Recommendations for further analysis

### 1) Expand the statistical analysis of weather conditions data to all months.
The simplest way to expand the scope of this analysis using existing data is to run the above analysis across fall and spring months in Oahu. Sustaining the business throughout the year will be a function of not only appealing to tourists in the area during peak months, but also by building a reputation among locals when surfing season does not have as many tourists.

### 2)Identify surfing hotspots by analyzing wave height data around the island to establish where in Oahu to open the surf/ice cream shop.
Analysing wave height data around the island could help us establish where in Oahu has the most surfing traffic. Since surfing is largely dependent on the quality (height) of waves, and surfers prefer to go where waves heights are larger, analyzing wave height data could give some insight into what locations in Oahu are most frequented by surfers. Based on this analysis, we can narrow down where to open up the shop so it has consistent traffic.

#### 2a)Combine wave height analysis with data regarding tourist hotspots.
To further strengthen wave height analysis, we can collect and create a database of tourist hotspots by gathering data on hotels and commercial centers, and cross-referencing those area names with the areas that are identified in the wave height analysis, and narrow down a list of locations for the ice cream shop. This would help us maximise traffic in peak seasons not only from surfers, but also from tourists who are not surfing.
